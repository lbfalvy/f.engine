An interactive lambda calculus engine combined with an introductory tutorial based on the information available on Wikipedia. It's not very efficient because it has to operate in the simplest way possible for the steps to remain easy to understand.

I wrote this because I wanted to explain lambda calculus to a friend, as such it's teaching material. If you write a new tutorial section I'd be very happy to add it, just open an issue and include a link (copiable from the browser's address bar after clicking the Share button).
